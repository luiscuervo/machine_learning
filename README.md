# machine_learning
Recopilation of diferent machine learning projects, done during my time at Projetto Conclusso.

Obtained accuracies (in balanced datasets):
- Covid detector: 78%
   - Classificates Cough recordings into positive and non positive 
- Cough detector: 98%
   - Differentiates coughs from similar sounds
- Sentiment Analysis: 95%
   - Differentiates 8 diffenert sentiments in recorded sentences
   
   
Both of them are audio analysis projects, where we applied computer vision on two different transformation of audio files:

- Covid and Sentiment --> Espectrogram
- Cough --> Filtering
