# machine_learning
Recopilation of diferent machine learning projects, done during my time at Projetto Conclusso.

Obtained accuracies:
- Covid detector: 78%
- Cough detector: 98%
- Sentiment Analysis: 95%

Both of them are audio analysis projects, where we applied computer vision on two different transformation of audio files:

- Covid and Sentiment --> Espectrogram
- Cough --> Filtering
