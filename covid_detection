# Covid detection algorithm

Here is the code for the covid detection algorithm. It consists on 3 pre-trained Resnets (Transfer learning) stacked over the other.

- Notes: For intelectual property reasons, the file MIT_models.py was not added, so the structure of the original ML models cannot be seen

## Files

- parameters.json --> Set up the parameters for the experiment (GPU distribution, file path, learning rate...)
- main.py --> Trains the model
- db_utils.py --> Contains database handling functions
- test_models.py --> Trains fully tested models
